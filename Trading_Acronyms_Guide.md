# 📚 Trading Acronyms & Terms - Complete Guide

## 🎯 Option Positions (Most Important!)

### **ATM - At The Money**
**What it means:** When the option strike price is equal (or very close) to the current stock/index price.

**Example:**
- NIFTY is at 25,935
- Your strike is 25,950
- **Status: ATM** (just 15 points away)

**Why it matters:** ATM options have the most time value and are most sensitive to price movements.

---

### **ITM - In The Money**
**What it means:** When your option has intrinsic value (it would make money if you exercised it right now).

**For Call Options:** Stock price is ABOVE your strike
**For Put Options:** Stock price is BELOW your strike

**Example:**
- VEDL is at ₹690.15
- Your call strike is ₹685
- **Status: ITM by ₹5.15** (profit zone!)

**Why it matters:** ITM options have real value. The deeper ITM, the more they move with the stock price.

---

### **OTM - Out of The Money**
**What it means:** When your option has NO intrinsic value (would be worthless if exercised now).

**For Call Options:** Stock price is BELOW your strike
**For Put Options:** Stock price is ABOVE your strike

**Example:**
- NIFTY is at 25,935
- Your strike is 25,950
- **Status: OTM by 15 points** (needs to go up)

**Why it matters:** OTM options are cheaper but riskier. They lose value fast as expiry approaches.

---

## 💰 Profit & Loss Terms

### **P&L - Profit and Loss**
**What it means:** Your total gains or losses on a position.

**Example:**
- NIFTY P&L: -₹1,316 (losing money)
- VEDL P&L: +₹1,495 (making money)
- Net P&L: +₹178.75 (overall slightly profitable)

---

### **RR - Risk Reward Ratio**
**What it means:** How much you could make vs. how much you could lose.

**Formula:** Potential Profit ÷ Potential Loss

**Example:**
- Risk: ₹1,000 (your stop loss)
- Reward: ₹3,000 (your target)
- **RR = 3:1** (good trade!)

**Why it matters:** Institutional traders only take trades with RR > 2:1 (risk ₹1 to make ₹2+)

---

### **ROI - Return on Investment**
**What it means:** Percentage gain or loss on your invested capital.

**Formula:** (Profit ÷ Investment) × 100

**Example:**
- Invested: ₹27,600 (VEDL)
- Profit: ₹1,495
- **ROI = 5.4%**

---

## 📊 Technical Analysis Terms

### **VWAP - Volume Weighted Average Price**
**What it means:** The average price weighted by volume. Shows where most trading happened.

**How to use:**
- Price above VWAP = Bullish
- Price below VWAP = Bearish

**Why it matters:** Institutional traders use it to get good entry prices.

---

### **POC - Point of Control**
**What it means:** The price level with the HIGHEST trading volume. Where most traders agreed on value.

**How to use:** Strong support/resistance level.

**Example:** If POC is at 25,900, NIFTY will likely bounce or reject there.

---

### **VA - Value Area**
**What it means:** The price range where 70% of trading volume occurred.

**Components:**
- **VAH** (Value Area High): Top of the range

---

### **HVN - High Volume Node**
**What it means:** Price levels with lots of trading activity (strong support/resistance).

**Example:** If 25,900 has HVN, expect the price to bounce there.

---

### **LVN - Low Volume Node**
**What it means:** Price levels with little trading activity (price moves through quickly).

**Example:** If 25,850 has LVN, price won't stay there—it'll gap through.

---

## 📅 Time Frame Analysis

### **HTF - Higher Time Frame**
**What it means:** Longer-term charts (Daily, Weekly, Monthly).

**Use:** To see the big picture trend.

---

### **LTF - Lower Time Frame**
**What it means:** Shorter-term charts (5-min, 15-min, 1-hour).

**Example:** Uptrend making lower highs = CHoCH (trend might reverse)

---

### **FVG - Fair Value Gap**
**What it means:** A price gap caused by imbalance (big candle with no overlap). Price often returns to fill it.

**Why it matters:** FVGs act as magnets—price comes back to fill them.

---

## 📈 Indicators

### **EMA - Exponential Moving Average**
**What it means:** Average price giving more weight to recent prices (faster than SMA).

**Common EMAs:**
- 20 EMA: Short-term trend
- 50 EMA: Medium-term trend
- 200 EMA: Long-term trend

**How to use:** Price above EMA = Bullish, below = Bearish

---

### **SMA - Simple Moving Average**
**What it means:** Average price over a period (all prices weighted equally).

**Example:** 50 SMA = Average of last 50 days

---

### **ATR - Average True Range**
**What it means:** Measures volatility (how much price moves on average).

**High ATR:** Big price swings (more risk, wider stops needed)
**Low ATR:** Small price movements (less risk, tighter stops)

**Use for:** Setting stop loss distances based on volatility

---

## 📊 Volatility

### **VIX - Volatility Index**
**What it means:** "Fear gauge" measuring expected market volatility.

- **VIX > 20:** High volatility (nervous market)
- **VIX > 30:** Extreme fear (crash potential)

## 🏦 Market Participants

### **FII - Foreign Institutional Investors**
**What it means:** Big foreign institutions (mutual funds, pension funds) investing in Indian markets.

**Recent:** FII bought ₹2,254 crore (bullish!)

---

### **DII - Domestic Institutional Investors**
**What it means:** Indian institutions (mutual funds, insurance companies).

**Why it matters:** They often counter FII moves, providing stability.

---

## 🎲 Options Strategy Terms

### **POP - Probability of Profit**
**What it means:** Statistical chance your option trade will be profitable at expiry.

**Example:**
- Iron Condor with 70% POP = 70% chance of profit

**Use:** Target strategies with POP > 70% for high probability trades.

---

### **DTE - Days to Expiry**
**What it means:** Number of days until your option expires.

**Your trades:** 15 DTE (Feb 26 expiry)

**Why it matters:**
- More DTE = More time value, less theta decay
