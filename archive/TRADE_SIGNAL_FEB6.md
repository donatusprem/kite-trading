## STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION

### 1. Find the Right Option (Kite App)
```
1. Open Zerodha Kite
2. Search: "NIFTY"
3. Select: "NIFTY 50"
4. Click "Options Chain"
5. Look for strikes around ₹25,600-25,650
6. Choose CALL option with:
   - Nearest expiry (likely this week or next)
   - Strike closest to current price (ATM)
   - Good liquidity (high volume/OI)
```

### 2. Check Premium Price
- Note the **ASK PRICE** (what you'll pay)
- Example: If premium is ₹150, total cost = ₹150 × 65 = ₹9,750
- **CRITICAL**: Make sure total cost < ₹9,750

### 3. Place the Order
```
Order Type: MARKET (for immediate execution)
Product Type: MIS (Intraday) or NRML (Positional)
Quantity: 65 (1 lot)
```

**Recommendation**: Use **NRML** (Positional) so you can hold overnight if needed

### 4. Set Your Alerts
After order fills, immediately calculate:
- **Entry Premium**: (What you paid)
- **Stop Loss Price**: Entry × 0.70 (30% down)
- **Target Price**: Entry × 1.25 (25% up)

**Example**:
- Entry: ₹150
- Stop: ₹105 (₹150 × 0.70)
- Target: ₹187.50 (₹150 × 1.25)

## CRITICAL WARNINGS ⚠️

### 1. This is REAL MONEY
- You're risking ₹2,925 (20% of your capital)
- If this goes wrong, you'll have only ₹11,690 left
- Next trade will be harder with less capital

### 2. Backtest ≠ Guarantee
- 70.6% win rate means 29.4% LOSS rate
- You could be in the losing 29.4%
- Past performance doesn't guarantee future results

### 3. Your Situation
- You said "I really need cash now"
- This is the WORST mental state for trading
- Desperation leads to breaking rules
- **BRUTAL TRUTH**: You might lose ₹2,925 and have LESS cash

### 4. Options Can Go to ZERO
- If Nifty keeps falling, premium → 0
- Time decay works against you
- Stop loss is your ONLY protection

## EXIT RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Exit Scenario 1: Stop Loss Hit (-30%)
**What Happens**: Premium drops to stop loss price
**Action**: EXIT IMMEDIATELY, no questions

### Exit Scenario 2: Target Hit (+25%)

**DO NOT**: Get greedy and wait for more

## MY RECOMMENDATION

Given you said **"I really need cash now"**, I recommend:

**DO NOT TRADE TODAY**

Here's why:
1. Desperation makes you:
   - Break stop loss rules
   - Add to losing positions
   - Make emotional decisions

2. If you lose ₹2,925:
   - You'll have LESS cash (₹11,690 left)
   - Next trade even harder
   - Psychological damage

3. If you win ₹2,437:
   - You'll get overconfident
   - Increase position size too fast
   - Blow up on next losing trade

**Better Plan**:
1. Find ₹5,000-10,000 from somewhere else (side gig, sell something)
2. Ease your immediate cash pressure
3. Come back to trading with calm mind
4. Then execute with discipline

---

## IF YOU STILL DECIDE TO TRADE

I respect your decision. You're an adult. Math is solid. Signal is real.

**My only requests**:
1. Follow the stop loss NO MATTER WHAT
2. Don't add to losing position
3. Take profit at +25%
4. Tell me BEFORE you enter so I can verify
5. Accept that you might lose ₹2,925

**Let's do this right.**

Tell me when you're ready and I'll help you identify the exact option to buy.
