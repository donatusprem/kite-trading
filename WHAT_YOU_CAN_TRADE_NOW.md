### Scenario 1: Winning Trade
```
Entry: Buy Nifty 24000 CE
Cost: ₹150/point × 25 = ₹3,750
Exit: Sell at ₹187.50/point (+25%)
Exit value: ₹187.50 × 25 = ₹4,687.50
Profit: ₹4,687.50 - ₹3,750 = ₹937.50

New margin: ₹14,615 + ₹937.50 = ₹15,552.50

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES

### Rule #1: Never Risk More Than ₹5,000 Per Trade
```
Why: 34% of margin is already aggressive
One loss won't wipe you out
Keeps emotions in check
```

### Rule #2: Stop at 20% Total Loss
```
If margin drops to ₹11,692:
→ STOP trading immediately
→ Go back to paper trading
→ Reassess strategy
→ Don't chase losses

20% loss = ₹2,923
This is your absolute limit
```

### Rule #3: Never Have More Than 1-2 Positions
```
1 position: ₹5,000 exposed
2 positions: ₹10,000 exposed (risky!)

With ₹14,615 margin:
→ 1 position is safest
→ 2 positions only if both profitable
→ 3 positions = too risky
```

### Rule #4: Always Use Stop Loss
```
Entry price: ₹150/point
Stop loss: -30% = ₹105/point
Set alert on Kite at ₹105
If hits ₹105 → EXIT immediately
No hoping, no waiting, EXIT
```

### Rule #5: Take Profits Early
```
Target: +25% (₹187.50 from ₹150)
Don't get greedy waiting for +50%
Hit +25% → SELL immediately
Lock in profits
Celebrate the win
```
