# Using Integrated Skills

This project integrates agentic skills from `anthropics/skills`.

## 1. XLSX (Excel) Manipulation
**Location**: `execution/utils/xlsx/`

### Purpose
To validate and recalculate Excel files generated by the trading system (e.g., Performance Reviews, Trade Journals). This ensures that formulas like `=SUM(B2:B10)` are actually computed and not just stored as strings.

### Usage
Run the `recalc.py` script on any generated Excel file:

```bash
python3 execution/utils/xlsx/recalc.py <path_to_excel_file>
```

**Example in Python Script:**
```python
import subprocess

# Generate Excel file using pandas or openpyxl...
output_file = "reports/performance.xlsx"
df.to_excel(output_file)

# Recalculate formulas
subprocess.run(["python3", "execution/utils/xlsx/recalc.py", output_file])
```

### Dependencies
- Requires LibreOffice (headless) to be installed on the system.
- `pip install openpyxl pandas`

## 2. MCP Builder (Future)
*Currently evaluating.*
To scaffold new Model Context Protocol servers:
```bash
# Potential future usage if integrated
python3 execution/utils/mcp_builder/create_server.py
```
