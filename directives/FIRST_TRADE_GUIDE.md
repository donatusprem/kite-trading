## 🎯 THE EXACT STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS

### PHASE 1: Pre-Market Preparation (Before 9:15 AM)

**What YOU Do:**
1. Wake up, check market news
2. Open Kite app
3. Check Nifty 50 chart
4. Add 20-day EMA indicator
5. Note current Nifty level

**What I Can Help With:**
- Analyze yesterday's close vs EMA20
- Check if signal conditions are met
- Calculate likely option prices
- Assess market sentiment

**How We Work Together:**
```
You: "Claude, current Nifty is 24,150 and EMA20 is 23,950. Is this a signal?"

Me: "Yes! Nifty (24,150) is above EMA20 (23,950). This is a BUY signal.
     Wait for market open to confirm. If it stays above EMA20 by 3 PM,
     then enter the trade."
```

---

### PHASE 2: Market Hours Monitoring (9:15 AM - 3:30 PM)

**What YOU Do:**
1. Watch Nifty price movement
2. Check if it stays above EMA20
3. Near 3:00 PM, check if signal holds
4. If YES, prepare to enter

**What I Can Help With:**
- Confirm signal is still valid
- Calculate exact strike to buy
- Determine position size
- Review entry conditions

**How We Work Together:**
```
You: "It's 2:45 PM. Nifty is 24,180, still above EMA20. Should I enter?"

Me: "Signal confirmed! Here's your trade plan:
     - Buy: NIFTY 24200 CE (nearest ATM)
     - Check current premium (should be ₹120-180)
     - If premium ≤ ₹200: BUY 1 lot (25 qty)
     - If premium > ₹200: Wait, too expensive

     Your entry checklist:
     ✓ Nifty above EMA20: YES
     ✓ Time: 2:45 PM (good)
     ✓ Premium reasonable: Check now
     ✓ Margin available: ₹14,615 ✓

     Ready to proceed?"
```

```
Step 1: Find the Option

Step 2: Calculate Cost
- Premium: ₹150 (example)
- Lot size: 25

Step 3: Place Order
- Order Type: LIMIT (safer than market)
- Limit Price: ₹150 (or current ask)
- Product: NRML (Normal)
- Quantity: 25
- Review total cost: ₹3,750

Step 4: Confirm & Submit

Step 5: Verify Fill

```

**What I Help With:**
- Calculate if premium is reasonable

- Confirm this matches the plan

**How We Work Together:**
```
You: "I'm seeing NIFTY 24200 CE at ₹152. Is this good?"

Me: "Yes, ₹152 is reasonable. Here's your confirmation:

     Cost: ₹152 × 25 = ₹3,800
     Margin needed: ~₹4,000
     Your available: ₹14,615 ✓

     Stop loss: ₹106.40 (₹152 × 0.70)
     Profit target: ₹190.00 (₹152 × 1.25)

     Max loss: ₹1,140

### PHASE 5: Daily Monitoring (Days 1-10)

**What YOU Must Do:**

**Morning (Before Market Open - 9:00 AM):**
```
1. Check Nifty pre-market levels
2. Check your option price (if market open)

```

**During Market (10:00 AM):**
```
1. Quick check of position P&L
2. Check if near stop loss or target

```

**Evening (After Market Close - 4:00 PM):**
```
1. Check final P&L for the day
2. Note option close price
3. Calculate days remaining (DTE)
4. Share update with me for tracking
```

**What I Can Help With:**

- Check if near exit points
- Advise on whether to hold or exit
- Track time decay

**How We Work Together:**

```
Day 1 Evening:
You: "End of day 1. Current price?"

Me: [Fetches from Kite] "Position update:
     Entry: ₹153
     Current: ₹148
     P&L: -₹125 (-3.3%)
     Days held: 1
     DTE: 9 days remaining

     Status: ✅ HOLD
     - Not near stop loss (₹107)
     - Not near profit target (₹191)
     - Time decay minimal
     - Stay patient, follow plan"

Day 3 Evening:
You: "Day 3 update?"

Me: [Fetches from Kite] "Position update:

     Current: ₹178
     P&L: +₹625 (+16.3%)

     DTE: 7 days remaining

     Status: ✅ HOLD (Getting close!)
     - Above entry ✓
     - Profit target: ₹191 (7.3% away)
     - If hits ₹191 tomorrow → EXIT
     - Let's see if it reaches target"

Day 5 Morning:
You: "It hit ₹192! Do I exit?"

Me: "🎯 PROFIT TARGET HIT!

     ✅ EXIT NOW - Don't wait!

     Current: ₹192
     Target: ₹191 ✓

     Place SELL order for 25 qty at market price.
     Lock in your profit!

     Expected profit: ~₹975

     Exit and send me confirmation."
```

### PHASE 6: Exit Execution (When Target/Stop Hit)

**What YOU Must Do:**

**If Profit Target Hit (₹191):**
```
1. Open Kite app immediately
2. Go to Positions tab
3. Click on your NIFTY CE position
4. Click "EXIT"
5. Select: Market order (fastest)
6. Quantity: 25 (full position)

9. Take screenshot
10. Send me confirmation
```

**If Stop Loss Hit (₹107):**
```
1. Same steps as above
2. DON'T HESITATE - Exit immediately
3. Don't hope it will recover
4. Take the loss, move on
5. This is part of trading
```

**If Time Limit Hit (Day 10):**
```
1. Exit at market price regardless
2. Even if small profit/loss
3. Don't hold past 10 days
4. Time decay accelerates after this
```

**What I Help With:**
- Confirm exit is correct decision
- Calculate final P&L
- Record trade in tracking sheet
- Analyze what went right/wrong
- Plan next trade

**How We Work Together:**

```

# - All holdings
```

### 2. Excel Tracking Sheet
```

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES - NO EXCEPTIONS

### Rule #1: NEVER Risk More Than ₹5,000 Per Trade
```
First trade: ₹3,825 ✓
Max allowed: ₹5,000 ✓
Don't even think about ₹6,000 or ₹7,000
```

### Rule #2: ALWAYS Use Stop Loss
```
Entry: ₹153
Stop: ₹107 (set alert NOW)
If hits ₹107 → EXIT immediately
No "let's wait and see"
No "it will bounce back"
EXIT = FINAL
```

### Rule #3: ALWAYS Take Profits at Target
```
Target: ₹191
If hits ₹191 → EXIT immediately
Don't wait for ₹200 or ₹250
Lock in profits
Greed kills
```

### Rule #4: NEVER Hold Past 10 Days
```
Day 10 → EXIT at market price
Even if small loss
Even if small profit
Time decay accelerates
Exit = mandatory
```

### Rule #5: Only Trade When Signal is Clear
```
✅ Nifty ABOVE EMA20 by 3 PM → Enter
❌ Nifty BELOW EMA20 → Don't trade
❌ Unclear signal → Wait
❌ Doubt → Don't enter

When in doubt, DON'T TRADE
```

A: Don't trade that day. Only trade when you can monitor.

A: Then don't trade. Fear means you're not ready. Paper trade more.

A: Stop. Go back to paper trading. Review strategy. Don't continue losing.
