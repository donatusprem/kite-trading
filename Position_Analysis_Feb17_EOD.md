- ✅ NIFTY tested 25,764 high today - got rejected
- ✅ Theta decay accelerating (losing ~₹1-2 per day)

## 🎯 POSITION #3: ADANIGREEN Bear Spread 🔴

### Position Details:
- **Short 1000 CE**: Entry ₹16.9, Current ₹31.9, Loss -₹9,000
- **Long 1010 CE**: Entry ₹13.6, Current ₹26.45, Profit +₹7,710
- **Net Loss**: -₹1,290 (-6.5%)
- **Expiry**: Feb 26 (7 days left)

### Technical Analysis:
- **ADANIGREEN Current**: 1,014.7 (**Both strikes ITM!**)
- **Short Strike**: 1000 (₹14.7 ITM)
- **Long Strike**: 1010 (₹4.7 ITM)
- **Today's High**: 1,016.7
- **Today's Move**: +2.37% (big move against you)

### What Went Wrong:
You created a **Bear Call Spread** expecting ADANIGREEN to stay below 1000, but:
- Stock rallied from ~991 to 1,014 (+2.37%)
- Both strikes are now deep ITM
- **Max Loss Scenario**: If stock stays above 1010 at expiry

### Win Scenarios:

**📊 Probability Analysis:**

| Scenario | Stock Level | Net P&L | Outcome | Probability |
|----------|-------------|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Full Recovery** | < 1000 | +₹5,400 | Both expire worthless | **5%** |
| **Partial Recovery** | 1000-1005 | -₹300 to +₹2,700 | Only 1000 CE ITM | **10%** |
| **Minimize Loss** | 1005-1010 | -₹2,700 to -₹300 | Both ITM, spread narrows | **10%** |
| **Max Loss** | > 1010 | -₹6,000 | Both deep ITM | **75%** |

### 🎲 **Overall Win Probability: 10%** 🔴

**Why Very Low Probability:**
- ⚠️ Stock rallied 2.37% today - strong momentum
- ⚠️ Both strikes are ITM by ₹14.7 and ₹4.7
- ⚠️ Need stock to fall -1.45% to get below 1000
- ⚠️ ADANIGREEN is volatile but trending up
- ⚠️ Only 7 days for reversal

**Critical Levels:**
- **Must break below**: 1010, then 1005, then 1000
- **Current trend**: Bullish (crossed 1015 high)

### 🚨 Action Plan:

**HOLD TO EXPIRY** (Max Loss is Defined)

**Why Hold:**
- Your **long 1010 CE protects you** - max loss is limited
- Selling now will lock in ₹1,290 loss
- Small chance stock falls back below 1010
- Max additional loss: ₹4,710 (from current -₹1,290 to max -₹6,000)

**Max Loss Calculation:**
- Spread width: 1010 - 1000 = ₹10 per share
- Quantity: 600 shares
- Max Loss: ₹10 × 600 = ₹6,000
- Net Credit Received: (₹16.9 - ₹13.6) × 600 = ₹1,980
- **True Max Loss**: ₹6,000 - ₹1,980 = ₹4,020

**Current Loss**: -₹1,290
**Additional Risk**: ₹2,730 (to reach max loss of ₹4,020)

**Expected Outcome**:
- **75% chance** of max loss at expiry
- **10% chance** of reducing loss
- **15% chance** of breaking even or profit

**Don't Exit Because:**
- Already in the trade, loss is capped
- Selling now = guaranteed loss
- Small chance of recovery in 7 days
